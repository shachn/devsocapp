          <p>pc builds</p>
          <p>Started flipping pcs in 2023-2024 - my boyfriend and I would buy secondhand parts on fb marketplace, build pcs & sell them. Learnt a lot about hardware and ended up building my own pc as well. He did a lot of the building & cable management and I was responsible for setting up software, benchmarking, and troubleshooting any issues.</p>

          <p>3d printing + laser engraving</p>
          <p>My dad has a Bambu Lab A1 printer. I've borrowed it a lot over the years to print various things - pc cases, storage containers, display holders, and keycaps. I also have a creality falcon 10w laser engraver, it works well with wood, acrylic & aluminium. I'm currently laser cutting the front cover for a NAS.</p>

          <p>doing nails</p>
          <p>I started doing my own nails in 2023, moved on to making press-on nails soon after, and started posting on instagram. I grew a pretty decent following and went to a couple artist market events in sydney and melbourne, which was really fun. Currently, I'm not doing press-ons anymore and am doing nails on people now :) Check out my instagram in the links section below.</p>

          <p>cars</p>
          <p>My boyfriend and I got really into cars after watching initial d last year. We've started modding his first car (a vw golf) and have been to a couple car meets around sydney as well. That's where I took this picture of an rx-7. I'm thinking of buying a volkswagen up! at the start of next year.</p>
